# school-projects 

(From our professor's homework description):

In this assignment, we wrote a program to solve mazes in the style and format of the mazes
that you generated in a previous project.  In doing so, we implemented a graph data structure using one of
the representations we discussed in class, and we implemented either Breadth-First Search or
Depth-First Search.  The goals of this assignment were for us to think about which representation
and search process best fit the needs of the problem we are solving, and, as usual, for us to get
more practice and experience implementing data structures (and debugging!).
